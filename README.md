# BoardGameChat
a platform that uses AI to help people learn and discover new board games

## Background
This project was created by [Brendan](https://github.com/iHappee), the Head of [Open Owl Studios](https://oommgames.com). Open Owl are the creators of [Stars of Akarios](https://oommgames.com/products/stars-of-akarios), [Mythwind](https://gamefound.com/projects/oomm-games/mythwindgame), and [Stonesaga](https://oommgames.com/pages/stonesaga) among others.

The team at BGC was created due to a shared desire to integrate the recent growth of AI into the board game community. This project began with Brendan experimenting with ChatPDF.com, which led to the creation of a small web app called boardgamechat.com that used chatGPT 3.5 to interact with a set of rulebook PDFs. After using it for a bit, Brendan realized that the best (and most fun) way forward for BoardGameChat would be to open-source it.

This is the ethos of the online board game community - we love to be involved and contribute to each other's projects, and this is a great platform to do just that.

## Discord
Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/jrY9XA62fJ) to chat with other board game enthusiasts and get updates on the project. This is the primary means of communication for our team.
